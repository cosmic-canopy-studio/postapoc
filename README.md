# PostApoc: Suviving and Thriving

Mashing
up
all
the
things
great
survival
games
in
pursuit
of
the
ultimate
surthrival
simulator.

## How to Use

1.
Clone
this
repository
and
run `yarn install`.

2.
Run `yarn dev --open`
opens
the
game
in
a
browser
at `localhost:8080`.

Click "
Start
Game"
or
press
space
bar
to
start.

## Milestones

This
project
exposes
the
evolution
of
it's
development
over
time
in
the
form
of
milestones.
Major
milestones,
linked
to
branches,
are
documented
to
give
moment
in
time
windows
in
to
the
game
and
it's
code
at
different
stages.

### Milestone 1: Phaser3 getting started

Followed
the [basic getting started guide](https://newdocs.phaser.io/docs/3.55.2)
to
create
a
basic "
Hello
World"
app. [Milestone 1 branch](https://github.com/Unnamed-GameDev-Studio/survival-game/tree/milestone-1).

### Milestone 2: An opinionated mashup of starter kits

This
repository
uses
the
a
combination
of [Phaser 3 + TypeScript Starter Kit](https://github.com/josephmbustamante/phaser3-typescript-starter-kit), [Phaser 3 Game Examples written in TypeScript](https://github.com/digitsensitive/phaser3-typescript),
and [Vite Phaser Game Starter](https://ubershmekel.github.io/vite-phaser-ts-starter/)
as
a
starting
point
with
a
few
modifications.
See [opinions.md](docs/opinions.md)
in
the
docs
folder
for
detailed
discussions
on
design
and
package
choices. [More information on the base starter kit can be found in this blog post](https://spin.atomicobject.com/2019/07/13/phaser-3-typescript-tutorial/). [Milestone 2 branch](milestone-2).

### Milestone 3: A person, a bench, and some violence

The
goal
of
this
milestone
is
to
start
implementing
game
features
and
adopt
best
practices
along
the
way.
Work
for
this
milestone
will
use
this [issue](https://github.com/Unnamed-GameDev-Studio/survival-game/issues/1),
which
describes
the
desired
features
and
includes
a
separate
staging
branch.
Features
will
start
on
a
feature
branch
that
will
merge
in
to
the
milestone
3
branch
via
pull
request.
This
repeats
for
merging
milestone
3
to
the
main
branch
upon
completion. (
think
of
this
as
the
public
release).
More
on
branches [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2100829/when-should-you-branch).

### Milestone 4: The steady hand of game systems (when properly tested)

This
milestone
represents
the
shift
from "
kicking
the
tires"
of
Phaser
toward
laying
a
foundation
that
is
solid
enough
to
build
a
game
on.
The
two
primary
objectives
are
de-coupling
code
with
an
eye
on
scalability,
and
testing
at
both
the
unit
and
behavioral
level.
The
summary
is
below,
see
the
opinions
page
in
the
docs
for
additional
discourse.

The
Composition
pattern
outlined
in
Robert
Nystrom's
talk [Is There More to Game Architecture than ECS?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxI3Eu5DPwE)
helps
build
loosely
coupled
systems
with
components
that
scale
and
are
easier
to
swap
out
compared
to
the
tightly
coupled
model
used
in
Milestone
3. [These](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKLntZcp27M&t=1769s) [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U03XXzcThGU)
were
also
helpful
in
coming
to
terms
with
optimal
patterns
derived
from
tough
lessons
learned.
Going
forward
design
changes
should
be
in
response
to
problems
or
constraints
encountered
while
building
in
an
attempt
to
avoid
gazing
in
to
the
infinite
abyss
of
optimal
pattern
metaphysical
meditation.

For
testing, [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
has
wide
adoption
resulting
with
many
useful
integrations,
and
no
is
harder
to
use
than
the
alternatives. [Wallaby.js](https://wallabyjs.com/)
is
a
VERY
helpful
visual
test
runner,
and
cucumber
integration
via [jest-cucumber](https://github.com/bencompton/jest-cucumber)
adds
some
BDD/TDD
capabilities
to
leverage
as
the
larger
parts
of
the
codebase
begin
to
stabilize.
Be
careful
not
to
confuse
jest-cucumber
with
cucumber-jest,
\_sigh\_.

The
repo
at
the
end
of
milestone-4
is
a
little
bloated
with
other
tools
as
I
experiment
to
find
out
what
is
useful
longer
term,
but
I
expect
to
trim
the
fat
once
I've
figured
out
the
sweet
spot.
One
parting
thought
on
the
matter,
the
process
of
trying
to
write
tests
laid
bare
many
areas
that
I
thought
I'd
done
a
sufficient
job
of
decoupling
that
told
a
very
different
story
when
I
went
to
write
a
few "
simple"
tests.
If
for
no
other
reason
I
think
this
makes
for
a
great
spot
checking
mechanism
on
how
clean
the
code
is.

### Milestone 5:

Hopefully
the
number
of
milestones
that
don't
add
actual
game
features
will
be
kept
to
a
minimum
going
forward.
For
this
milestone
I
intend
to
pursue
the
initial
aspects
of
the
crafting
system,
which
means
the
bench's
death
with
not
go
without
purpose.
Along
the
way
some
UI
overlays
are
likely
to
end
up
in
the
mix,
and "
thing"
related
data
will
be
pushed
to
config
files.
True
components,
observer,
dirty
objects
